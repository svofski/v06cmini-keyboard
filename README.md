A miniature keyboard for Vector-06c
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The keyboard is a miniature full-functioning replica of Vector-06c keyboard. Its dimensions are 150x55mm. 
It can be connected as a replacement keyboard to the real Vector-06c, or it can be used as a USB HID keyboard with a Vector-06c emulator or FPGA implementation.
It can also be connected to v06c-esp vector-06c-mini.

The design files comprise 3 parts. 

 1. Key caps
 2. Bottom PCB
 3. Top PCB

This keyboard is very small indeed.
